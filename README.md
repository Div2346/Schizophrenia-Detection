# Schizophrenia-Diagnosis
Schizophrenia Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health disorder affecting more than a million new people 
in India per year. It is a psychotic disorder which affects a person’s ability to think, feel and 
behave clearly. People suffering from Schizophrenia have hallucinations, delusions and 
extremely unordered thinking which can lie on a scale of being unharmful to being severely 
dangerous. People with Schizophrenia may develop different brain structures over time as 
compared to the people without the condition. Schizophrenic brains may have lesser ‘gray 
matter’ overtime. In our project, we extracted posts from reddit with the subreddits being 
the various uploaded texts belonging to nine different topics: Schizophrenia, personal 
finance, fitness, depression, jokes, conspiracy, divorce, meditation and teaching. We 
assigned the posts on the topic Schizophrenia 1 and the control posts (topics other than 
Schizophrenia) 0 as the indicators. We have preprocessed the data and then applied various 
supervised machine learning models to classify these posts followed by RNN and LSTM 
based techniques for text-classification.


Through this project we aim to classify and differentiate the Schizophrenic groups from the 
non – schizophrenic groups (control posts) utilizing text data consisting of posts on Reddit 
and belonging to 9 sub-reddits. With the advance of machine learning technologies, early 
detection of disorders such as Schizophrenia has become easier, this prompts the degree to 
which a person’s illness can be harmful and encourage them to attain medical facilities for 
help.
